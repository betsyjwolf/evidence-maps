# What works for whom: Evidence maps of study data in the What Works Clearinghouse
This repository provides open access to data analyzed in the paper, "What works for whom: Evidence maps of study data in the What Works Clearinghouse" (under review).

## Abstract

The What Works Clearinghouse at the Institute of Education Sciences reviews rigorous research on educational practices, policies, programs, and products with a goal of identifying “what works” and making that information accessible to educators. One critique of the WWC is the need to more closely examine ‘what works’ for whom, in which settings, and for which outcomes. The purpose of this white paper is to map the What Works Clearinghouse study data to describe the evidence base across different student populations, settings, and outcomes. Findings highlight areas for which there is much evidence, as well as areas where more high-quality research is needed. Findings also suggest that the evidence on ‘what works’ depends on the outcomes  and student samples included in the studies.
