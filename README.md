# What works for whom: Exploring the students, settings, and outcomes in What Works Clearinghouse study data

This repository provides open access to data and materials from the paper (in press).

## Abstract

The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) at the Institute of Education Sciences reviews rigorous research on educational practices, policies, programs, and products with a goal of identifying ‘what works’ and making that information accessible to the public. One critique of the WWC is the need to more closely examine ‘what works’ for whom, in which settings, and for which outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to create evidence maps of the WWC study data to display the settings, student populations, and outcomes included in the evidence base. Findings show that the WWC study data include a broad range of settings, students, and outcomes relevant to education in the U.S., yet missing data on sample characteristics are a concern. The WWC evidence base also includes relatively few studies focused on specific student subgroups and outcomes. Finally, findings suggest that ‘what worked’, or the extent to which studies found favorable results, meaningfully depended on which outcomes were included in the studies. The findings have implications for researchers, funders of research, and the WWC.
