# What works for whom: Evidence maps of study data in the What Works Clearinghouse
This repository provides open access to data analyzed in the paper, "What works for whom: Evidence maps of study data in the What Works Clearinghouse" (under review).

## Abstract

The What Works Clearinghouse at the Institute of Education Sciences reviews rigorous research on educational practices, policies, programs, and products with a goal of identifying “what works” and making that information accessible to the public. One critique of the WWC is the need to more closely examine ‘what works’ for whom, in which settings, and for which outcomes. The purpose of this white paper is to map the What Works Clearinghouse study data to describe the evidence base across different student populations, settings, and outcomes. Findings show that the WWC study data include a broad range of settings, populations, and outcomes, yet include relatively few studies focused on specific student subgroups. The WWC study data also include a broad range of educationally-relevant outcomes, but would benefit from more evidence in some outcomes and a greater breadth of evidence for some subgroups. Findings also suggest that ‘what worked’, or the extent to which studies found favorable results, meaningfully depended on the outcomes included in the studies. These findings have implications for researchers, funders of research, and the WWC.
